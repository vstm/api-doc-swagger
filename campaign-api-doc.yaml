        All the properties are optional, only the supplied properties are changed.
        
        Notice that when changing the customer, it will apply the new customer discounts automatically. 
        
        When changing or setting agency/intermediator, by default, commissions will be set to the values found in the agency/intermediator again. Even if the commission was set on the flight. Updating agency/intermediator to `null` will, by default, set the commissions to `0` and the `commissionStatus` as well to `0`.
        
        When agency/intermediator are sent in the body and you don't want to update the commissions you can use the query parameter `update_commissions=0`.
      parameters:
        - in: query

          description: >
            Whether to update commissions or not
             * **0**: commissions will not be updated and stay the same even if agency and/or intermediator are changed. Flights created hereafter will use the old commissions.
             * **1**: commissions will be updated only if the payload as well has values set for the intermediator or agency. Flights created hereafter will always use those commissions as well. If you have set custom flight commissions manually on flights, they will be reset to the values of the agency/intermediator.

            Use this value only if you want to explicitly define the billing type of the campaign. You can safely omit this value
            to let goTom apply the rules for finding the right billing type for this campaign.
            
            Billing type possible values and their meaning:
            
             * `0` - Custom - The user must explicitly set up the invoices and assign flights
             * `1` - End / Nach Ablauf - All flights are automatically assigned to one invoice
             * `2` - Monthly to daily value /  Monatlich nach Tageswert - Automatic assignment on a monthly basis, distributed by time
             * `3` - Monthly to delivery value / Monatlich nach Lieferwert - Automatic assignment on a monthly basis, distributed by delivery value
             
            Please note, that your instance may not support all values. If your instance does not have an
            ad-server integration the value for "Monthly to delivery value" can't be used.
            If you use a value that is not supported by your instance, you will get an
            API error (code `7e44e734-3535-4172-8e32-0efa8b33a5e0`) with the list of the possible values
            for your instance.
