            You get this report ID by saving a graph report. For example:
             1. Go to [https://example.com/statistic/graph-report/show](https://example.com/statistic/graph-report/show), enter a name for the report and press save.
             2. Read out the resulting `savedReportId` in the following page e.g. `https://example.com/statistic/graph-report/saved/46` where 46 is the `savedReportId`
             3. Use the `savedReportId` to call this endpoint with e.g. `/app-api/graph-export/download/46`
